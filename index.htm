                    <p>Don't get me wrong: I love Airbnb. </p>

                    <p>Airbnb has created a sense of belonging <i>all over the world.</i> It's given everyone the opportunity to travel like a local. It's a fantastic product.

                    <br>

                    <p>Through initiatives and features like #onelessstranger, Airbnb Open, and the Airbnb Groups feature, Airbnb has empowered hundreds of thousands of people to become hosts, entrepreneurs, and friends.</p>

                    <p>That all said, there's one feature in particular that is <strong>missing</strong> that could make a <i>big</i> impact. Airbnb has done an incredible job building resources and features for hosts, but...<p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="site-align-c"><strong>What features have strengthened the other side of Airbnb: the travelers?</strong></p>
                    <br />
                    
                    <p>Yes, the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/stories/memphis/from-guest-to-host">connection</a>  between a Airbnb host and guest is often special - but many users still don't feel that it replaces the experience of meeting up with other travelers. Hostels do this really well.</p>

                    <p>While the <i>hotel</i> industry has lost marketshare due to Airbnb, <i>Hostels</i> still have a strong competitive advantage: meeting fellow travelers that they can <i>explore</i> with and fulfill their sense of wunderlust.</p>

                    <br><br><strong>"In my experience, airbnb doesn't really provide you with these kinds of social opportunities, and if you want to meet people or make friends, you're kind of on your own." <a href="http://www.quora.com/As-a-young-person-visiting-a-new-city-by-myself-should-I-get-a-place-on-AirBnB-or-stay-in-a-hostel"> - Quora</a></strong>

                    <p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wehostels">Other</a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hostelworld-com">companies</a> are picking up on this advantage, too. Airbnb already provides travelers with a local, unique expeierence, but doesn't excel in this (crucial) area. 

                    <p> Luckily the solution here is straighforward, but, like anything, is <i>sensitive</i> on the execution.
                    <br><br>

                    It could help create a <i>much</i> higher lifetime value for airbnb customers. It could even <i>double</i> the booking rate for users that are longing for something like this <i>(and there are plenty)</i>.<br><br> There's a lot of value in building a strong culture.

                    <h1 class="site-align-c">The solution:</h1>
                    <br />
                
                     Give Airbnb guests the same great network to travel with as hosts have recieved, while still making it feel like a natural part of the user exeperience. <br><br>

                     A solution to let the travelers better explore together, using Airbnb. <br><br>

                     Like a travel <strong>Caravan</strong>, or an Airbnb group for travelers, that activates when a user makes a booking for a particular area and connects them with others traveling there too. It's a hostel lobby, <i>in your pocket.</i><br><br>

                     Airbnb Caravans would function similiar to the Airbnb "groups" tool, but, again, like anything, is <i>sensitive</i> on the execution, and needs someone to help champion the implementation.

                            <li>Articlate and evangalize how this aligns with our values, mission, and how we're going to specifically measure the impact (change in LTV, for example).</li><br>
                            <li>Work with our team to develop a feature roadmap based on the user feedback that has a strong vision, but broken up into trackable & digestable, goals.</li><br>
                            <li>Test and launch several iterations, execute on the little things, work with other teams on feature integration, and continue to share the product vision.</li><br>
                            <li>Champion the process all the way through. Put in hard work, have a ton of fun, and learn alot  :)</li>
